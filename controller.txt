The car will know its trajectory taken using a high precision GPS system or using SLAM mapping.
For prediction of change in environment is taken care by Extended Kalman filter :
1)It predicts the next state based on previous state only, no need for history of data. (so the 
initial data should be correctly given)
2)It is computationally very fast making it suitable for real time problems and it reduces noise,
 error and uncertainty by giving a gaussian distribution.
A good controller should reduce the constraints on mobility, speed of motion, high-speed operation,
 complex interaction with the environment and typically a lack of prior information.

An adaptive PID controller can be taken as a good controller. The requirement of the adaptive PID
 control is control of the system's internal parameters independent of a precise mathematic model
 and that the parameters are adjusted automatically in real time until the error values are reduced
 to minimum by the controller.
